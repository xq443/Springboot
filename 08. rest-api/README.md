### REST API
#### Definitions
- API: Mediator between a consumer and a system
- REST API: API that conforms to a set of guidelines.
- JSON: universal format of key-value pairs that all systems can understand.
```
{
    "name": "Tyrion Lannister",  //JSON STRING
    "phoneNumber": "4515429321",  // JSON STRING
    "age": 40,  // JSON NUMBER
    "height": 1.2,  // JSON NUMBER
    "siblings": [ "Cersei", "Jaime" ], // JSON ARRAY
    "alwaysDrunk": true // JSON BOOLEAN
}
```
### REST Guidelines:
- Resource: piece of data that can be named (Contact, Employee).
- URI: Uniform Resource Identifier â€“ identifies the location of a resource.
- The API defines operations that can manipulate resources:
  - GET: retrieves a resource.
  - POST: creates a resource.
  - PUT: updates a resource.
  - DELETE: deletes a resource.
- The resource is most often serialized into JSON.

### Spring Boot REST
- @RESTController:
  - Combines @Controller and @ResponseBody.
- @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping:
  - method-level annotations that instrument methods to handle different types of requests.
- @ResponseBody:
  - is capable of serializing a returned Object into JSON.
- @RequestBody
  - is capable of deserializing incoming JSON data into the fields of an object.
- @PathVariable: extracts a variable from the provided path.

- ResponseEntity<Object>:
  - object is serialized into JSON before being sent off.
  - can also return an HTTP status code. See Mozilla Status Codes.

- @JsonFormat:
  - can configure how properties get serialized. The following example serializes the annotated field into a JSON STRING, with a pattern of dd-MM-yyyy hh:mm:ss.
    @JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.STRING, pattern = "dd-MM-yyyy hh:mm:ss")
    
- @Valid: validates fields based on your constraints

### Exception Handling
- @ControllerAdvice: class-level annotation that allows you to define global exception handlers.
  - handleMethodArgumentNotValid: method that can be overridden from the ResponseEntityExceptionHandler parent class. You can handle field violations and get the BindingResult here.
- @ExceptionHandler: method-level annotation that defines an exception handler.


### Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) 
- is a string of characters used to identify a resource.
- A URI can be further classified into two types: URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and URN (Uniform Resource Name).
  - URL (Uniform Resource Locator): It specifies the location of a resource on the internet and the protocol used to access it. For example:
    
  ```
  https://www.example.com/index.html
  ```
  - URN (Uniform Resource Name): It provides a unique name for a resource without specifying its location or how to access it.
  - URNs are used to uniquely identify resources but don't provide a means to access them. For example:
    
  ```
  urn:isbn:0451450523
  ```
  - Both URLs and URNs are subsets of URIs, which provide a standardized way to identify resources, whether they are located on the internet or not.
